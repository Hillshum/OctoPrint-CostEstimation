# OctoPrint-CostEstimation

## UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT

    Hi everybody,
    because there was no activtiy in the last month on the origial GitHub-Repository from @malnvenshorn,
    the community deceided to find a new home of this OctoPrint-Plugin and here it it ;-)
    See https://github.com/OctoPrint/plugins.octoprint.org/issues/623 for more details

    What is my roadmap/stratagy of "hosting" this plugin?
    - First: Plugin should run under the latest versions of Python and OctoPrint
    - Analysing/fixing issues that prevent using the plugin
    - An open mind for new ideas

This OctoPrint plugin displays the estimated print cost for the loaded model. The print cost includes the price for the used filament the maintenance and operating cost for the printer as well as the depreciation of the printer.

HINT: The Cost-Calculation is based on the generated Metadata from OctoPrint. OctoPrint stores such data in the upload folder in the file ```.metadata.json```.
Look for your file then and you shoul see a analyse section like this:
![CostEstimation](screenshots/costestimation-metadata.png?raw=true)

If the metadata is not present you will see ```no filament from meta```

To fix this, go to the "Plugin-Settings / Features" and switch "Analyze gcode..." to "always".

See https://github.com/OllisGit/OctoPrint-CostEstimation/issues/9

## Features
- Calculation based on the provided filament length (```.../uploads/.metadata.json```)
